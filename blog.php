        This planet is not only for the human existence but is also for all other living creatures. They also have the
        same
        right to existence in this planet. So as animals, they also posses certain rights which are even granted by our
        national
        laws. As like human beings they cannot fight for the protection for their rights we human being can do the same
        for
        those creatures. Animal Rights is the idea that some or all, non human animals are entitled to the possession of
        their
        own lives and that their most basic interest- such as need to avoid suffering- should be afforded the same
        consideration
        as similar interest of human beings. These rights are the rights of animal to be protected from human use and
        abuse and
        can take moral, legal and practical forms. People who support animal rights believe that animal are not ours to
        use as
        we wish for whatever purpose, be it for food, clothing, experimentation or entertainment. They also believe that
        we
        should consider the best interest of animal regardless of usage they may have for us. The right to humane
        treatment
        claimed on behalf of animals, especially the right not to be exploited for human purpose.
        <br><br>
        In our Indian tradition and culture almost all the animals ha a respect and special place in our society. But
        the
        situation is not the same in present time. They became easy target to earn quick money. Healthy young animals
        were
        killed leather, meat and for different commercial purposes which are not allowed by the law. Thousands of animal
        are
        performing in circuses.
        <br><br>
        The Prevention of Cruelty of Animals Act, 1960 under section 11(1)(a) to (o) prescribes different forms of
        cruelty and
        makes it punishable with imprisonment and fine. Section 428 and 429 of IPC 1860 make it illegal to maim or cause
        injury
        to any animal. The Wild Life Protection Act is also present for protecting the life of wild animals. Article 51
        A of our
        Constitution also lays down fundamental duties for every citizen one of which included compassion for living
        creature.
        In form Article 21 under the heading of Right to life and personal liberty vast right is given to everyone. So
        anyone is
        at liberty to do good things for the animals. Now one of the important issue is raised by the people those who
        are
        taking care of street dogs and other animals sometime they faces problem. In this regard Delhi High Court stated
        that
        the Animal Welfare Board and Municipal Authorities need to work with them. Inspite of all the laws and measures
        taken by
        the authorities the animal rights are constantly infringed by us human beings. The only way to protect their
        right may
        be minimization of the commercialization of animalâ€™s and awareness among the masses.
